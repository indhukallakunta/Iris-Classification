# Iris-Classification
A simple machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using their petal and sepal measurements. The model is trained and evaluated on the classic Iris dataset.

# 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy & Pandas
